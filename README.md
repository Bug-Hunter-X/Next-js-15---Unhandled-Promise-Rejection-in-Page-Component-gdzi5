# Next.js 15 - Unhandled Promise Rejection in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications: unhandled promise rejections during data fetching within page components.  The `about.js` file contains the problematic code, which attempts to fetch data without proper error handling. The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original `about.js` attempts to fetch data using `fetch` within the component.  If the fetch fails (e.g., network error, server error), the promise rejects, and this rejection isn't caught, leading to an error in the browser's console and potentially a broken user experience.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version. This version uses `async/await` with a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the fetch. If the fetch fails, an appropriate error message is displayed to the user, preventing a runtime crash.  Consider adding more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms as needed for production applications.
